Tesla CEO Elon Musk has suggested that users should switch to the Signal app in a tweet, directed against WhatsApp. This tweet comes after WhatsApp announced a revision to its privacy policy signalling further integration with Facebook over data sharing. Interestingly, WhatsApp uses the same end-to-end encryption protocol as Signal. Further, the Signal Foundation, which shares its name with the app, includes former WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton as one of its founders.

It looks like a lot more people are trying out Signal, and the app was not prepared to handle the influx of new users. Several of them were not getting verification codes to create an account in Signal app because of a flood of new users. “We are working with carriers to resolve this as quickly as possible. Hang in there,” Signal said on Twitter. In case you are unaware, Signal is a cross-platform encrypted messaging app, which has been downloaded by around ten million users already.
